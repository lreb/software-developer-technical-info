# Net

Main Components

.NET applications are written in the C#, F#, or Visual Basic programming language. Code is compiled into a language-agnostic Common Intermediate Language (CIL). Compiled code is stored in assembliesâ€”files with a .dll or .exe file extension.

1. C# Code : Object Oriented Programming, Type Safe, Interoperability, Scalable and Updated, Component Oriented, Structured programming language, Rich Library, Fast speed.
2. Class Library: shared library concept for .NET. They enable you to componentize useful functionality into modules that can be used by multiple applications.  It provides types for strings, dates, numbers, etc. The Class Library includes APIs for reading and writing files, connecting to databases, drawing, and more.
3. Common Language Runtima (CLR): engine that handles running applications. It provides services like thread management, garbage collection, type-safety, exception handling, and more.

4. Common Intermediate Language (CIL): Compiles source code into assemblies .dll or .exe files
5. Just In time Compiler (JIT): uses assemblies to turn into machine code that can execute on the specific architecture of the computer it is running on.
6. Machine Code: Binary code that is executed by the CPU.
